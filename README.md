# garfield
This is a modified vervion of Garfield++ originally from http://garfieldpp.web.cern.ch/garfieldpp/ .
This version contains the ability to load a CLAS12 azimuthally-symmetric solenoid magnetic field map into the ComponentElmer class.

To compile GMSH, Elmer, and Garfield files for the BONuS12 RTPC - cd to bonus/rtpc, then:

- RTPC.geo which is the file used to define the geometry for the finite 
element method (FEM). 

- RTPC.msh which is the mesh file. The mesh is the list of all finite 
elements in our geometry. It has been created with:

> gmsh RTPC.geo -3 -order 2

- RTPC/mesh.boundary, RTPC/mesh.elements, RTPC/mesh.header, and 
RTPC/mesh.nodes. These files will be read by ElmerSolver to create the 
electric file and later by Garfield. They were created with:

> ElmerGrid 14 2 <mesh_file>.msh -autoclean

- RTPC.sif, which is the file defining the physics to apply to the 
mesh. The boundary conditions (values of potentials) are implemented 
there.

- RTPC/RTPC.result and RTPC/RTPC.ep. Only the .result file will be 
relevant for simulations with Garfield, as the .ep file is meant to be 
read into a visualization program. They were created by:

> ElmerSolver RTPC.sif

which performs the calculation described by the given solver input file 
(sif).

- RTPC.C and makefile which are the files used for the Garfield 
simulation. To run it do:

> make 

(it will create a executable called RTPC_garf)

> ./garf_RTPC

# How to use ComponentElmer::LoadMagneticField()
First, you must create a CSV file of the solenoid field map in the format

radial distance [cm], z-distance [cm], Bx [T], By [T], Bz [T]

where the radial distance must be at values 3.1, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 6.9 cm

z-distance contains values from -20 to 20 cm in 0.5 cm increments

and B-values are the values at that point.

If you want to alter any of this formating, you can open and change things under the memeber functions ComponentElmer::LoadMagneticField() and ComponenetElmer::MagneticField() in the ComponentElmer.cc file.

This assumes azimuthal b-field symmetry.

Then in the RTPC.C file, all you need to do is change the function 

LoadMagneticField("<magnetic-field.file>", scaleB)

where magnetic-field.file is the map that you created and scaleB is the scaling value of the field that you want (0-1).
